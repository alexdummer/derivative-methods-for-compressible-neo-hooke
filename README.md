# Derivative Methods for Compressible Neo-Hooke

In this repository we provide source code for an investigation on methods for computing stress and tangent operators from a compressible hyperelastic potential function.
For stress and tangent computation first and second order derivatives of the potential function are required. We compare numerical differentiation based on finite difference approximations, complex step derivative approximations and automatic differentiation using hyper dual numbers to the analytically derived solutions.
